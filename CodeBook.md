## The factors to identify data
- Subject	Person ID who attended the experiments
- Activity	Activity name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

## Measurements
- tBodyAcceleration-XYZ
- tGravityAcceleration-XYZ
- tBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAngularVelocity-XYZ
- tBodyAngularVelocityJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccelerationMag
- tGravityAccelerationMag
- tBodyAccelerationJerkMag
- tBodyAngularVelocityMag
- tBodyAngularVelocityJerkMag
- fBodyAcceleration-XYZ
- fBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ
- fBodyAngularVelocity-XYZ
- fBodyAccelerationMag
- fBodyAccelerationJerkMag
- fBodyAngularVelocityMag
- fBodyAngularVelocityJerkMag

“-XYZ” is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
- mean	Mean value
- std	Standard deviation
